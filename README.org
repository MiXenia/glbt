A slightly-abstracted layer on top of raw GL/GLAD/GLFW.

- Written in plain C89 with no frills so as to be extensible in other languages via FFI.

- Honestly I just got tired of writing boilerplate GL code in whatever languages I wanted to explore.

Contributors to ./bindings/ welcome if you know how to write C bindings in your favorite language!
